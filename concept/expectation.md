# expectation
An expectation can optionally be provided when requesting calculations from
Anna. Then not only some [input](input.md) is provided, but also some
expectation required to be met for the calculated [output](output.md). This
concept enables reinforcement learning. Iteration for iteration
[connections](connection.md) are evaluated, weakened and strengthened. That way
learning happens.
