# permutation factory
The permutation factory permutes the order of the members of an arbitrary list
that implements the interface of a permutation list. Advantages of the
permutation factory is memory effiency and reproducability. It is memory
efficient because all possible combinations are not stored in memory, but
created on demand. Depending on the provided delta the creation can be quiet
fast in case the delta is not too big. The factory is reproducible because of
the index used to represent a permutation. So in case the given delta is way
too big one might want to provide the indizes directly. Then the permutation is
pretty fast because it is basically about looking up some map entries.

### example

Imagine the following example.

```
[]interface{"a", 7, []float64{2.88}}
```

This is how the initial factory permutation looks like. In fact, there is no
permutation.

```
[]interface{}
```

This is how the first factory permutation looks like.

```
[]interface{"a"}
```

This is how the second factory permutation looks like.

```
[]interface{7}
```

This is how the third factory permutation looks like.

```
[]interface{[]float64{2.88}}
```

This is how the Nth factory permutation looks like.

```
[]interface{[]float64{2.88}, "a"}
```
