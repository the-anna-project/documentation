# autocompletion
There are two tools: `annad` and `annactl`. For both we have autocompletion.
Unfortunately these are manually written and need to be maintained and kept in
sync with the current implementations. See

- [annad completion for zsh](/completion/zsh/_annad)
- [annactl completion for zsh](/completion/zsh/_annactl)
