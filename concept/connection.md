# connection
The connection model is the most important concept of the Anna project. A
connection can be seen as a neural connection. Such connections represent
relationships between certain information and behaviours, represented in a multi
dimensional space. [Inputs](input.md), [outputs](output.md) and [CLGs](clg.md)
are wired together that way. Many of these connections interacting together
dynamically, represent Anna's neural [network](network.md). Note that this
document is eventually up to date. The nature of the Anna project is currently
to be in rapid development. Concepts and ideas can change quite quickly.

### space
The connection space can be seen as a multi dimensional vector space. In theory
it's dimensions can represent everything: space, time or even conceptual weights
representing something like emotions. Information and behaviours are mapped onto
the connection space by having coordinates applied. A coordinate represents a
location within the connection space, which is calculated by interacting with
[the balance system](distribution.md#balance-system). The balance system is used
to make dimensions create tensions on coordinates within the connection space.
Each dimension is pulling into its own direction. The important idea behind the
tensions created here is that they are balanced. One dimension pulling
coordinates spontaneously into a certain direction makes another dimension move
proportionally into another direction. If one dimension goes up, another
dimension goes down. Thus a balance is created. This creates a simulation of
psychological interactions on different levels. Like disgust and attraction
cannot go together. Aim of such a balance system is to provide built in
mechanisms of leveraging event interactions and calculating connection locations
within the connection space.

Spontaneous modificatins of connections lead to variances within applied
behaviours. Leads some behaviour to successful results, slight adjustments of a
CLG tree's coordinates can be stored, which causes the CLG tree to be updated.
This will improve CLG trees over time, because behaviour was adjusted to the
given environmental feedback that Anna has received. That means the balance
system influences connections within the connection space, and thus behaviour of
the whole neural network. Thus coordinates are used to calculate dynamic and
individual connection locations within the connection space. They are also used
to calculate certain similarities between information, and certain similarities
between behaviours.

The following picture illustrates the connection space. For simplicity it only
shows two dimensions, `x` and `y`. We see two different CLG trees within the
connection space. Here some peers are pretty near to each other. We can
calculate a similarity based on the distances between peers. An indicator for
common connection patterns can also be derived from the shape of a connection
path.

### creation
When creating new connections it is important to not create weak connections.
Each connection that exists only exists because it brought some kind of value in
the past. The process of creating connections is a continuous task, that is
fully dynamic and learned by experience.

When information is provided, it is stored within the underlying storage. The
creation of behaviour connections takes place on the CLG level. A connection is
represented as single key-value pair. The key of such a key-value pair simply
consists of a behaviour ID. The value of such a key-value pair is a list of
behaviour IDs. All newly created connections are persisted within a trial scope
in the first place. The purpose of such a trial scope is to label all stored
data within the current creation process as volatile. If the neural network
succeeds to solve a problem with some newly created connections, the connections
stored within a trial scope are persisted as regular connections and thus not
considered volatile anymore. In case the created connections did not lead to
some successful operation, all volatile connections stored within a trial scope
are simply removed.

A connection can also have a TTL. In this case the connection itself is somehow
volatile on purpose, because it is supposed to connect peers only for a certain
amount of time. Why this is done and how long such a connection exists is up to
the neural network itself.

Anyway, there needs a decision to be made to forward signals to some CLGs. The
following strategies are considered when it comes to create new connections
within the connection space.

1. *Bias* is some manually provided hint, intended to guide some CLG tree into a
   certain direction. Read more on this in this issue:
   https://github.com/the-anna-project/annad/issues/44.

2. *Intuition* is some sort of vague feeling that points into a certain
   direction. Drawing distantly related connections across multiple levels can
   gather information and generate new relations between peers.

3. *Copy* connections from other branches looks up possible connection
   structures from different problem domains. Connections that have been useful
   in one problem domain might be useful as well in another.

4. *Random* connections can be drawn if none of the preceding options are
   available. This is the most weak way to create new connections, because it
   does not consider any additional information.

### lookup
The process of looking up connections is triggered on demand and thus must be
optimised for fast execution.

The lookup of connections happens within each CLG's execution scope to fetch all
the peers that needs to be known to forward signals to. Connections will be
looked up as they are stored. Spontaneous connections are made by CLGs who think
this is sufficient.

### data structure
Designing a data structure is quite important. Smart systems need to store
information efficiently. The wrong data structures will cause huge amounts of
data or cause high latency for business logic tasks. The following data
structure design aims to be efficient and fast while meeting the requirements of
Anna's business logic. Note that the following documentation does not aim to
track a complete list of all data structures used for the Anna project. We only
try to document the most important key-value pairs to transport ideas. It might
happen that some information are missing. In this case the missing information
should be added below. Anyway, we use key-value pairs to store data and describe
relations between objects where possible because of simplicity and speed. The
notation of the described data structures reads as follows.

- Everything within angle brackets (`<>`) reads as variable.
- On the left is the key, on the right is the value of the key-value pairs.
- When talking about a `<prefix>`, we talk about some internal storage prefix,
  which is simply used to prefix data structures to a certain scope. This
  prefix might also indicate a relation to some `<trial-scope>`.
- When talking about a `<clg-tree-id>`, we talk about an identifier for
  combined, executable behaviour.
- When talking about a `<behaviour-coordinate>`, we talk about a single point
  within the connection space, which represents one single CLG associated with a
  very specific CLG tree. A CLG's coordinate represents its location within the
  connection space. This representation of a CLG's location is calculated
  continuously by interacting with the balance system. Thus coordinates might be
  recalculated to align them to successful CLG trees.
- When talking about a `<behaviour-ID>`, we talk about a very unique identifier
  of a CLG, which is generated for each CLG execution that is not related to an
  already known CLG tree ID. That way a single CLG can be represented as unique
  CLG with its own very unique connections and behaviours.
- When talking about an `<information-coordinate>`, we talk about a single point
  within the connection space, which represents one single information sequence.
  An information sequence's coordinate represents its location within the
  connection space. This representation of an information sequence's location is
  calculated continuously by interacting with the balance system. Thus
  coordinates might be recalculated to align them to successful connection
  paths.
- When talking about an `<information-sequence>`, we talk about a single piece
  of information, which is either provided from the outside, or generated
  internally.

their names don't. The following key maps a single behaviour ID to its unique
CLG name.

```

### abstraction
The described model above can be abstracted and used for other different things
as well. E.g. a mapping of conceptional ideas can be achieved by implementing
certain CLGs. For instance one CLG which adds a mapping between two given
strings, where these strings represent some concepts like `tree` or `house`.
Another CLG reads such mappings and acts according to some pattern it decided
for. Having enough entropy and time given this behaviour will lead to
surprisingly results. The important thing for on this level of abstraction is
simplicity. We only use very simple key-pairs to represent connections, which
gives the neural network enough room to figure itself out how to act best.
