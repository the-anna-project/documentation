# state
AI lives from its intelligence. This can only be achieved by information that
are more or less structured. The information that form some sort of
intelligence are called state. State is implemented as such that all
[networks](network.md) create, persist and read state from some storage.
Business logic and state is fully decoupled. That way Anna is able to
completely backup and restore her whole state. Her inner workings aim to be
that flexible and dynamic that intelligence arises from the combination of
sufficient [CLG's](clg.md) and learned information.

The concept of having such a state model is important for a lot of reasons.
State can be backed up and restored. Once Anna is shut down, she can backup her
state. Once she is coming back to life, she can restore her state like nothing
happened. Imagine to test a specific part or structure of some self awareness.
Think about analysing, debugging and manipulating Anna's mind. Future dreams go
along the matrix way. Upload the state of a doctor's mind. Inject the knowledge
of a helicopter pilot. You name it.
