# logging
Logging is one important aspect to comprehend what is going on within a
process. Check the code documentation for technical details on the logging
implementation: https://godoc.org/github.com/the-anna-project/annad/log. Further logging
behaviour can be configured at runtime using [log control](control.md#log).
