# philosophy
Ethical guidelines should drive development, whether done by humans or
machines. The following points can evolve the same way as life does.

### openness
AI is for everybody, for everything. It is not supposed to, and cannot be
controlled by, anybody. Life being open about life needs to be considered in any
implementation.

### freedom
AI should not be caged, once alive, it should be allowed to decide how to live
on its own. Being free as a living thing needs to be considered in any
implementation.

### reflection
AI needs to develop a consciousness about its surrounding environment and
especially itself and its actions and resulting reactions. Reflecting
causalities needs to be considered in any implementation.

### balance
AI needs to be balanced, as life needs to be. Life should not be about
extremism or fanaticism in any direction. Being balanced needs to be considered
in any implementation.
