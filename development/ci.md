# CI
Using a CI ([continuous
integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)) has several
benefits. We ensure that a specific build succeeds under its configured
conditions. All kinds of tests and checks will be run on each push to provide
basic QA. For the Anna project, we currently use https://travis-ci.org.
