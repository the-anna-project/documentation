# makefile
> A [makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) is a file containing a
> set of directives used with the make build automation tool.

The makefile is used to ease the development of the project. You may want to
make use of the following targets.

### all
This target starts code generation and compiles the `annad` binary.
```
make all
```

The `all` target is the default target. So the following is shorter and also
valid once the project is set up using `make setup`.
```
make
```

### annad
This target compiles the server binary `annad`. This binary can be executed to
launch Anna as process running on your system.
```
make annad
```

### dockerimage
This target builds a docker image using the [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile).
Therefore docker as dev dependency is required.
```
make dockerimage
```

### dockerpush
This target pushes a docker image to the docker repository under
https://hub.docker.com/r/xh3b4sd/anna/. Therefore docker as dev dependency is
required as well as access to the docker repository. This might be only
interesting for the maintainers.
```
make dockerpush
```

### devdeps
This fetches all dependencies required for the development process.
```
make devdeps
```

### gofmt
This is for manual code formatting. There is probably no need to use this
target on a regular basis in case there already is some automated formatting
integrated into your text editor.
```
make gofmt
```

Now what happened? Because of our directory structure and `Makefile` magic the
`.workspace` directory was created and extended with the source code
dependencies.
```
~/projects/private/anna
├── ...
└── .workspace
    ├── ...
    └── src
        ├── github.com
        │   ├── ...
        ├── golang.org
        │   └── ...
        └── gopkg.in
            └── ...
```

Further some development tools were installed, necessary for some other
Makefile targets.
```
~/projects/private/anna
├── ...
└── .workspace
    ├── ...
    └── bin
        ├── ...
        ├── gocyclo
        ├── golint
        └── misspell
```

### gotest
This runs the golang unit tests to ensure basic functionality and a decent coverage.
```
make gotest
```

You should see something like this.
```

```

### projectcheck
This is to ensure some QA aspects like spelling, source code formatting and
others. Check `project.check.sh` for the details. It is recommended to make use
of this during your development cycles. Checks done here are also done during
CI builds. Using the following command every now and then prevents pushing
faulty branches.
```
make projectcheck
```

You should see something like this.
```
go vet    succeeded
golint    succeeded
misspell  succeeded
gocyclo   succeeded
gofmt     succeeded
```

### setup
This target is the very first you need to execute when starting with the project
from scratch. It puts all dependencies in place.
```
make setup
```
