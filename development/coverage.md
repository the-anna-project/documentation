# coverage
Code coverage helps improving code quality. Decent coverage tools give insights
of the statements that are covered and which are not covered. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage for more information about code
coverage in general. For the Anna project we make use of https://codecov.io.
