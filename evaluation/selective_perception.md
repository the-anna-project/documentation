# selective perception
**Note that the following is not fully thought through and is currently only
there to help to form more concrete ideas around solutions.**

Make Anna identify, choose and operate on specific words of certain input. A
fundamental requirement for successful operations with humans is finding
specific information within neural networks.

Selective perception probably should be a
[BB](/doc/concept/clg.md#bb-basic-behaviour). Using this we could make Anna
understand that a certain request needs to lead to the usage of a certain
behaviour. So we effectively provide some context and point to the neuron it
needs to be associated to. Thus Anna is able to execute the neuron on the
context and create a connection between the context and the neuron. Finally
selective perception should be a dynamically learned behaviour and cause
consciously connected neurons within Anna's neural networks.
