### typos
The following sentences provide some information. The challenge here is to
grasp the point. There is a failure that needs to be recognized. The second
sentence uses the word `eine`, but this should be `keine`. This little detail
is important to understand the meaning of this description.

Er kann jedoch selbst eine Auskunft dar√ºber machen.

Diese Information kann der Arzt geben.

### observation
It would be interesting to make Anna communicate with and observe herself.
E.g. she could do something and provide records of what she has done in a form
as it would be provided by some external instance. Maybe that way we could
make her explore herself up to a stage where she realizes that action and
reaction are related and even come from the same individual. That is, herself.
