# documentation
The documentation repository aims to hold all relevant information about The
Anna Project. All documentation is done using markdown files.Code documentation
can be found at in the form of godoc in the separated repositories. Check the
organization for an project overview: https://github.com/the-anna-project.
**Note that the documentation is almost always outdated to a certain extend due
to the rapid development of the projects and its concepts. It would be cool to
catch up with all the TODOs at some point. At the moment, and in the foreseeable
future, making the shit work has the highest priority. Feel free to help with
whatever you like.**

## abstract

> AI is the last invention humanity will ever need to make.

This is not about machine learning. This is about machines learn to learn. This
is about general purpose artificial intelligence. Machine learning with all its
scientific theories and approaches is still way too rigid. To make AI actually
work we need to make them as dynamic as possible. The way to a truly intelligent
system is probably so hard and long nobody can just code it right away. Humanity
needs to discover the path of creating something flexible and smart as human
brains sometimes pretend to be. Walking this very long road alone seems to be
insane. Since the industrial revolution machines helped us to faster achieve
better results. We aim to go along the way to AI, step by step, with Anna
together. See the [roadmap](roadmap) for an idea about the various stages this
project aims to reach.

Anyway, this project is still pretty new. For quite a while now I am thinking
about machine learning and AI. This field is fascinating and challenging in so
many different ways. I want to use this project as playground to improve
knowledge by solving problems pragmatically.

In fact the aim is to implement something living. Something that learns and
develops by itself. Something that solves the problems we are not capable of.
This ambitious dream should drive this project. Wether it is driven by me,
somebody else, or some group of people way smarter than me. Life will find a
way.
