This is the 29th diary entry. Thinking thinking thinking.

Unfortunately I have not enough time to get a little bit more speed into the
develoopment. In the last weeks I was pursuing the new conceptual ideas like
already described in the last diary entry.

These days the docs got some love. I threw away old documentation that already
have been invalid. Information about all thew new ideas and big pictures were
added. For instance the concept of
[connections](https://github.com/the-anna-project/annad/blob/78d2e16e2fa6ed6f31a1bd8a3bf25f712fa6ad4c/doc/concept/connection.md)
was bugging me way too long. I had no idea how to make connections between
information and behaviour actually work. The connection model needs to reflect
dynamic relations between arbittrary peers. At the same time the connection
model needs to use data structures that allow fast access and also allow
storing information in an efficient way. The [data
structure](https://github.com/the-anna-project/annad/blob/78d2e16e2fa6ed6f31a1bd8a3bf25f712fa6ad4c/doc/concept/connection.md)
description explains how the connection model currently is designed to be
implemented.

Further the CLG documentation received some love. Have a look at the idea of
[the intelligence gap](/doc/concept/clg.md#the-intelligence-gap). Even more to
see is in the new [stage
concept](https://github.com/the-anna-project/annad/blob/78d2e16e2fa6ed6f31a1bd8a3bf25f712fa6ad4c/doc/concept/stage.md)
documentation and the updated [strategy](https://github.com/the-anna-project/annad/blob/78d2e16e2fa6ed6f31a1bd8a3bf25f712fa6ad4c/doc/concept/strategy.md).
