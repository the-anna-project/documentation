This is the 10th diary entry. This time not that much happened, but it is cool
anyway.

I added a file system abstraction, a file system mock. So Anna can use the real
file system implementation by default and we can inject a memory file system
for testing.

Purpose of the whole thing is of course testing. A lot of things happened
recently about the state model. Now there is a pretty big test case that
verifies the behaviour of backing up and restoring state.
