This is the 8th diary entry. Logging was introduced.

This was conceptually not nicely possible because dependency injection would
have been taken place in different places and in different forms. So from now
on all objects are initialized at the very beginning to have a proper state.
The objects hold different states. E.g. the default state that is used to track
the actual runtime state. Further there is a initialization state that holds
blue prints of objects. Thus this object state acts as object factory.
Dependency injection happens straight forward without deep nested data
structures. The object itself has the ability to act as a object factory to
initialize whatever object it needs to proceed. This is espacially useful when
thinking about neurons that need to create new neurons providing very different
behaviours.

Once some restructuring was done logging was able to be provided for all
objects. Simple print statements are replaced by the injected logger. Check

details.
