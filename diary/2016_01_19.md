This is the 6th diary entry. Long story short. There was a problem of the first
gateway implementation. It was only capable of pushing data into the core, but
not able to also receive a corresponding response. Based on a [cool
article](http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2013/11/23/understanding-chan-chans-in-go/)
I found, I was able to got the gateway implementation right by still using
golang channels. Additionally the refactoring had the side effect that the
separation and the architecture of the components that interact with each other
is better than before.
