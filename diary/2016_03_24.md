This is the 21th diary entry. Here I want to write about a problem that I try
to solve currently.

I was thinking about how to detect semantic relationships and meaning for
sequences. The question is, how to make a machine understand what a `tree` is.
See this sequences.
```
Trees have leaves.
Trees have roots.
Children have lollipos.
Children have shoes.
```

My thoughts went along this line. One could calculate some semnatic distance
with respect to word occurrences. Taking the first sequence, one could argue
that `trees` are semantically closer to `leaves` than to `children`, because
trees and leaves occur within the same sequence. This approach has one issue.
`have` is as close to `trees` and `leaves` as trees are to leaves. Even worse.
`have` is closer to the nouns than the nouns to each other. I had this theory.
```
### semantic relationship
To detect meaning, we need to see knowledge as a network, no matter if we can
make information visible or not. We need to find the nodes with the most
connections. These information can be used to feed the balance system
dynamically. Anyway I think we really need visualization to truly understand
the meaning of things, to grasp contextual information over time and space
where information flow in. Further imagine the following problem. Having an
arbitrary sentence given, there are words that are more and there are words
that are less descriptive. E.g. a noun like `tree` has more semantic meaning
and is more descriptive than the word `have`. We can try to find out what
sequences have a dedicated meaning by looking up connections between nodes
within the knowledge network. Inspecting the lookups outcome we will see that
nodes connected with the `tree` node are more tightly coupled and
interconnected. The picture of the connections of the `have` node should be
more mixed across all kinds of different semantics, causing contradictionary
information.
```

The idea is cool, but it has an issue as well. I can write these valid
sequences that screw the concept.
```
Children have no leaves.
Children don't have roots.
Lollipops not have roots.
Trees do not have shoes.
```

Sure, we could teach a programm using supervised learning, but I am against
such manual interventions during learning processes. This needs to be as
automated as possible. Thus the concept is not sufficient enough. That is
challenging. Reading up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_and_no it is going to be even more interesting.
```
Some languages do not answer yesâ€“no questions with single words meaning 'yes'
or 'no'. Welsh and Finnish are among several languages that typically employ
echo answers (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form)
rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though both languages do also have
words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'.
