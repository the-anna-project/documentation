This is the third diary entry. After documentation was written it was time to
implement the first interface. This was intended to consum data on behalf. Text
is the first straight forward input Anna should consume.

The software should be designed API driven, so the text interface was
implemented over an HTTP API. Microservices are hyped as hell so there must be
a neat framework. Recently there were rumors about one. After checking around
[go-kit] (https://github.com/go-kit/kit/) was used. Its design is pretty nice
and the code feels alright in the first place.

Idea is to always have server and client. Having a command line that
understands the protocols and API's makes it way more easier to work with. The
CLI probably will be named `annactl`.
