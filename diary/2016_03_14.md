# 2016.03.14
This is the 19th diary entry. This time I missed to write the diary directly.
So lets see what I can recall.

Lets have a look at the commit message of the last pull request merge.
```
add session support across requests
  - improved pull request templates
  - improved ideas about character tree structures
  - create key package
  - store hash maps
  - remove context package
  - better strategy and impulse interface
```

Further I made some brainstorming notes. This was simply to visualize ideas and
how stuff works. Such notes are quite helpful when I get stuck. It is often
that when I am too focused to see a problems solution, I take a context switch
too zoom out. Then, after a while, the solution gets me on its own. Anyway,
here are the notes.
```
└── CoreNet
    ├── InNet
    │   ├── CharNet

What                                                   Where

1. some input comes in                                 Server
2. a job is created                                    Server
3. input is session related                            -
4. impulse walks through networks                      -
5. information are persited                            -
6. session input is attached to impulse's context      CtxNet
7. another input comes in                              Server
8. the first job is replaced by a new job              Server
3. input is session related                            -
4. impulse walks through networks                      -
5. information are persited                            -
6. session input is attached to impulse's context      CtxNet
```

I also did a lot of research towards machine learning and stuff. Watched a lot
of videos. Read a lot of papers. There is a lot of interesting stuff out there.
But in short: machine learning is still at its beginnings and some of the
things that currently already work, are not well understood. When watching
videos of people having a name within the community, they sometimes talk about
crazy things they don't understand that well on their own. I think a lot of
scientific theory is only theory as I ever thought. There is a need for
pragmatic solutions, and this is what I am doing here. And again, it is funny
to see that there are concepts out there I already came up on my own without
researching in a certain direction. It is then only that the wording of this
concepts differ, but the base lines are the same.

Anyway, I thought about crazy things. Artificial minds. See the evaluation
documents as follows.
