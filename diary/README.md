# diary
The diary aims to document the mental process and evolution of ideas of this
project. It is not necessary to have documentation for each and every day. It
is rather important to document ideas and decisions chronologically. Goal of
this is to keep track of influences and events that drove development and
decisions. All ideas and walkthroughs are precious and good to know.

To know how to write an diary entry, see the [structure](structure.md)
