This is the second diary entry. No real work happened. Reason for documentation
is some mental work. Distraction took place and research in different
directions happened. In some other projects TLS encryption needed to be solved.
This is quite interesting and gathering information about various concepts and
ideas was really cool. The time was well spent. Having in mind that Anna needs
to be distributed somehow, authentication and encryption should probably be
done.

Question was how encryption and the internet works. It turned out that there
are several critical problems. When communicating over a network parties need
to know with whom they are talking to. Parties need to ensure that messages
received are not manipulated by others. They also want to have their messages
encrypted, so others cannot read what they are talking about. Too little time
to check and deeply understand all this quite interesting, scientific and
academic information. What flashed the most is a cool video the principle of
the [Diffi-Hellman Key Exchange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do).
