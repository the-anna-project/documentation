This is the 26th diary entry.

In the last days I tried to move forward the actual strategy creation. This
requires knowledge about which CLGs work together. We already have CLG
profiles, but since the CLG interface takes and returns a list of arbitrary
values we need to find out on which underlying data types each CLG operates.
The whole project is generic. So writing down which CLG works with which CLG
would be static and error prone. Thus there need to be a way for Anna to
discover CLG connections by herself. This is why we need something that creates
arguments, executes a CLG, and checks what comes out at the end. This something
is called the argument factory. It makes use of the permutation factory that
permutes a list of arbitrary values by a given delta that is applied to its
indizes. The permutation factory is already implemented. Check the godoc for
more information:
https://godoc.org/github.com/the-anna-project/annad/service/permutation. The argument
factory still needs to be implemented though. I am thinking about creating an
`ArgNet` inside the `StratNet` to gather information about concrete CLG
interfaces. The step after this would be to create a `ChainNet` which purpose
is to constantly chain CLGs to strategies. The generated strategies then can be
used in the upper `StratNet`.

What also happened recently was some refactoring towards the id creation. Now
there is a `IDService` that is more easily testable and resilient.
